      <h1>Aligning Classifications</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        A classification, in the context of statistics, is a breakdown
        of a statistical population into subdivisions and often into a
        hierarchy. Normally the subdivisions partition the whole
        population &mdash; they are mutually exclusive and collectively
        exhaustive (MECE). Each statistical dataset has a
        classification for each of the dimensions it uses. While some
        classifications are standardised (NUTS, SIC 2007), some are
        more ad hoc, extended from other classifications, or mixed
        together based on what the original questions were of the
        data.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        As we publish more statistical data, we will need to establish
        methods and tools to manage the relationships between
        classifications and the dimensions used in the datasets,
        especially when moving from stove-piped publication of
        statistics that are not explicitly linked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harmonisation can be thought of as a process of agreeing on
        common definitions of things such that, in the future, we can
        move to using more standardised classifications. In the
        meantime, we can potentially create correspondence between the
        current classifications and these harmonised classifications
        such that the data can be re-published and adjusted or mapped
        to the new classifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alignment is a process that can help with harmonisation,
        though it is concerned more with determining relationships
        between existing classifications such that we can identify
        what is the same, what is overlapping, what is different and
        how things relate to external data. Alignment must take into
        account the inherent constraints of classifications so as to be
        consistent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Linking statistical data is therefore about making explicit
        the relationships between things, in this case between
        classifications, dimensions and also any external
        definitions. While there is some existing linkage between
        datasets through the use of already harmonised
        classifications, there are many other classifications used
        with various pedigrees that haven't been harmonised. The
        default for those classifications is to make no assumptions
        and publish the classification as it is used in the data, in
        its own name-space and separate from other
        classifications. Only where classifications used are
        demonstrably the same as each other should they be given the
        same name-space.

      <p>
        Todo: last bit alludes to the Open World Assumption; should explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Todo: explain what we get from linking and alignment:
        <ul>
          <li>We can ask cross cutting questions about e.g. a single
        country's migration and trade without having to work out what
        different identifiers are used in the different datasets.</li>
          <li>We're not presented with multiple filters of what appear
        to be the same thing (world, whole world, all nationalities;
        multiple links to Germany).</li>
          <li>By linking to external info we can follow to find out
          e.g. population, flag, language</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Migration Example 1</h2>
      <p>
        We'll consider two datasets from different government
        departments that use similar but not quite the same breakdowns
        for nationality.
      </p>
      <h3>The Home Office</h3>
      <p>
        The Home
        Office <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-statistics-october-to-december-2017-data-tables">publish
        immigration statistics</a> including a spreadsheet
        called "<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/683359/entry-visas1-oct-dec-2017-tables.ods">entry
        clearance visas granted outside the UK</a>".
      </p>
      <p>
        Nationality in this dataset is based on documentation provided
        by the person requesting a visa, though it is complicated as
        countries and nationalities change over time.

      <blockquote class="blockquote text-right">
        <p class="mb-0">
          In the Immigration Statistics release, some data are
          available by country of nationality. The country of
          nationality recorded is based on the documentation,
          generally passports, provided by the individual at the point
          of recording the details. For asylum statistics, the country
          of nationality is usually based on documentary evidence,
          although sometimes the asylum seeker would arrive in the UK
          without any such documentation.

        The User Guide provides a table at the end with a list of all
        the countries along with their old and new groupings,
        according to

      <p>
        As part of the process of transforming the data published in
        the spreadsheet into something that we can use in COGS, we
        extract the nationality classifications that are used in the
        data and record this separately as a "concept scheme" &mdash;
        a data structure for representing tree-like breakdown of the
        countries and groupings. At this stage, the concept scheme
        is <a href="https://github.com/ONS-OpenData/ref_migration/blob/master/codelists/ho-country-of-nationality.csv">stored
        as a CSV file</a> which we can just about visualise as a
        radial tree below. Note that the top (shown in the centre) of
        the breakdown is "All nationalities" and there are two other
        levels of groupings.

      <p>
        Datasets from Department for Work and Pensions and the Home
        Office use similar but slightly different breakdowns to
        classify the nationality of people, perhaps due to the
        reclassification mentioned in the methodology.</p>
      <p>
        Again, as part of the transformation process, we extract the
        nationality classifications that are used in the data and
        record them in a concept scheme, currently stored
        in <a href="https://github.com/ONS-OpenData/ref_migration/blob/master/codelists/ho-country-of-nationality.csv">another
        CSV file</a> and visualized in a radial tree below. Note this
        time that the top of the tree is "World" and there are again
        two levels of groupings.

      <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-1by1">

      <h2>Linking things together</h2>
      <p>
        As they stand, the two classifications use separate
        name-spaces for the identities of the countries and
        groupings, so that for instance, the Home Office
        has <code>&lt;http://gss-data.org.uk/def/class/ho-country-of-nationality/germany&gt;</code>
        while DWP
        uses <code>&lt;http://gss-data.org.uk/def/class/dwp-nationality/germany&gt;</code>
        for what may or may not be the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using <a href="http://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a>, we can
        <a href="https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Reconciliation">reconcile</a>
        the two codelists with Wikidata to relate each nationality
        with a corresponding Wikidata entity. Most of these entities
        should be countries, though some are territories, some are
        groups and some have no obvious correspondence.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following combined classification is then derived automatically as follows:
        <ol>
          <li>The MECE constraints of the two separate classifications are made explicit as simple rules / constraints.</li>
          <li>The Wikidata link is made "inverse functional", meaning
          that if two different identifiers are linked to the same
            Wikidata entity, then two identifiers both represent the same thing.</li>
          <li>The dimension for each dataset is the same</li>
        </ol>
        An automated reasoner is then run to work out what the
        consequences are for the resulting combined classification. In the
        diagram, the nodes are coloured as follows:
        <dl class="row">
          <dt class="col-sm-1 text-right" style="color: #a2a;">Purple</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-11">Country/group is inferred to be the same in both classifications.</dd>
          <dt class="col-sm-1 text-right" style="color: #aa2;">Yellow</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-11">Country/group is only in the Home Office classification.</dd>
          <dt class="col-sm-1 text-right" style="color: #2aa;">Cyan</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-11">Country/group is only in the DWP classification.</dd>
          <dt class="col-sm-1 text-right" style="color: #a11;">Red</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-11">Country/group breaks some constraint/rule.</dd>
        </dl>
      </p>
      <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-1by1">
        <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="tree.html#dwp-ho-nationalities.json"></iframe>
      </div>
      <p>
        At this stage the diagram tells us that:
        <ul>
          <li>A few countries haven't been reconciled yet or are in
          one but not the other classification.</li>
          <li>"Cyprus (Northern part of)" has broken some
          constraint.</li>
          <li>Some groupings have been inferred to be the same based
          on their sub-grouping being the same, e.g. "EU 14".</li>
          <li>Some groupings, although they've been inferred to be the
          same, still show up multiple times as they are in different
          subdivisions.</li>
          <li>"World" and "All nationalities" are still distinct.</li>
        </ul>
        Note that the reasoner uses the "open world assumption", which
        means that until we can demonstrate that things are the same
        (or different), we can't assume they're not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking through the results of the Wikidata reconciliation, some issues can be resolved:
        <ul>
          <li>The Home Office distinguish between Cyprus and "Cyprus (Northern part of)", which were wrongly given the same Wikidata ID Q229, whereas the Northern part has ID Q23681.</li>
          <li>Macedonia should have ID Q221, not Q83958.</li>
          <li>"Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba" can be given ID Q27561.</li>
          <li>The DWP lists "Aruba and Curaçao" and this has no single
          ID in Wikidata, it being two islands. There is a grouping,
          known as the ABC islands, for Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao
          with ID Q19386. For the purposes of this alignment, we can
          just state that the DWP's Aruba and Curaçao class is the
          same as the (disjoint) union of the Home Office's two
            separate classes: Aruba and Curaçao.</li>
        </ul>
        This results in the following picture:
      </p>
      <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-1by1">
        <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="tree.html#dwp-ho-nationalities2.json"></iframe>
      </div>
      <h3>Woods and trees</h3>
      <p>
        While this combined breakdown is gradually making more sense,
        what we're ultimately hoping for is that the two populations
        for DWP and the Home Office can be shown to be the same: that
        is that "All nationalities" and "World" should represent the
        same population, just broken down in different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        We need to concentrate on what the current differences are by
        filtering out those countries and groupings that have already
        been deemed to be the same (the purple ones):
