      <h1>Aligning Classifications</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        A classification, in the context of statistics, is a breakdown
        of a statistical population into subdivisions and often into a
        hierarchy. Normally the subdivisions are non-overlapping and
        cover the whole of the population (MECE). Each statistical
        dataset has a classification for each of the dimensions it
        uses. While some classifications are standardised (NUTS, SIC
        2007), some are more ad-hoc, extended from other
        classifications, or mixed together based on what the original
        questions were of the data.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Aligning vs Harmonising. Latter is a process of agreeing on
        common definitions that can be used in future. Normally think
        of creating a new classification that everyone can map
        to. Alignment on the other hand is the process of figuring out
        the relationships between classifications such that we can
        identify what is the same, what is overlapping and what is
        different.

      <h2>Migration Example 1</h2>
      <p>
        We'll consider two datasets from different government
        departments that use similar but not quite the same breakdowns
        for nationality.
      </p>
      <h3>The Home Office</h3>
      <p>
        The Home
        Office <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-statistics-october-to-december-2017-data-tables">publish
        immigration statistics</a> including a spreadsheet
        called "<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/683359/entry-visas1-oct-dec-2017-tables.ods">entry
        clearance visas granted outside the UK</a>".
      </p>
      <p>
        Nationality in this dataset is based on documentation provided
        by the person requesting a visa, though it is complicated as
        countries and nationalities change over time.

      <blockquote class="blockquote text-right">
        <p class="mb-0">
          In the Immigration Statistics release, some data are
          available by country of nationality. The country of
          nationality recorded is based on the documentation,
          generally passports, provided by the individual at the point
          of recording the details. For asylum statistics, the country
          of nationality is usually based on documentary evidence,
          although sometimes the asylum seeker would arrive in the UK
          without any such documentation.

      <p>
        The User Guide provides a table at the end with a list of all
        the countries along with their old and new groupings,
        according to
        an <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/get-involved/consultations-and-user-surveys/consultations/country-groupings-in-international-migration-statistics/index.html">ONS
        consultation of 2014</a>.

      <p>
        As part of the process of transforming the data published in
        the spreadsheet into something that we can use in COGS, we
        extract the nationality classifications that are used in the
        data and record this separately as a "concept scheme" &mdash;
        a data structure for representing tree-like breakdown of the
        countries and groupings. At this stage, the concept scheme
        is <a href="https://github.com/ONS-OpenData/ref_migration/blob/master/codelists/ho-country-of-nationality.csv">stored
        as a CSV file</a> which we can just about visualise as a
        radial tree below. Note that the top (shown in the centre) of
        the breakdown is "All nationalities" and there are two other
        levels of groupings.

        The DWP publish data

      <p>
        Datasets from Department for Work and Pensions and the Home
        Office use similar but slightly different breakdowns to
        classify the nationality of people, perhaps due to the
        reclassification mentioned in the methodology.</p>
      <p>
        Again, as part of the transformation process, we extract the
        nationality classifications that are used in the data and
        record them in a concept scheme, currently stored
        in <a href="https://github.com/ONS-OpenData/ref_migration/blob/master/codelists/ho-country-of-nationality.csv">another
        CSV file</a> and visualized in a radial tree below. Note this
        time that the top of the tree is "World" and there are again
        two levels of groupings.
      </p>
      <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-1by1">

      </div>
      <h2>Linking things together</h2>
      <p>
        As they stand, the two classifications use separate
        "namespaces" for the identities of the countries and
        groupings, so that for instance, the Home Office
        has <code>&lt;http://gss-data.org.uk/def/class/ho-country-of-nationality/germany&gt;</code>
        while DWP
        uses <code>&lt;http://gss-data.org.uk/def/class/dwp-nationality/germany&gt;</code>
        for what may or may not be the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using <a href="http://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a>, we can
        <a href="https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Reconciliation">reconcile</a>
        the two codelists with Wikidata to relate each nationality
        with a corresponding Wikidata entity. Most of these entities
        should be countries, though some are territories, some are
        groups and some have no obvious correspondence.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following combined classification is then derived automatically as follows:
        <ol>
          <li>The MECE constraints of the two separate classifications are made explicit as simple rules / constraints.</li>
          <li>The Wikidata link is made "inverse functional", meaning
          that if two different identifiers are linked to the same
            Wikidata entity, then two identifiers both represent the same thing.</li>
          <li>The dimension for each dataset is the same</li>
        </ol>
        An automated reasoner is then run to work out what the
        consequences are for the resulting combined classification. In the
        diagram, the nodes are coloured as follows:
        <dl class="row">
          <dt class="col-sm-1 text-right" style="color: #a2a;">Purple</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-11">Country/group is inferred to be the same in both classifications.</dd>
          <dt class="col-sm-1 text-right" style="color: #aa2;">Yellow</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-11">Country/group is only in the Home Office classification.</dd>
          <dt class="col-sm-1 text-right" style="color: #2aa;">Cyan</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-11">Country/group is only in the DWP classification.</dd>
          <dt class="col-sm-1 text-right" style="color: #a11;">Red</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-11">Country/group breaks some constraint/rule.</dd>
        </dl>
      </p>
      <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-1by1">
        <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="tree.html#dwp-ho-nationalities.json"></iframe>
      </div>
      <p>
        At this stage the diagram tells us that:
        <ul>
          <li>A few countries haven't been reconciled yet or are in
          one but not the other classification.</li>
          <li>"Cyprus (Northern part of)" has broken some
          constraint.</li>
          <li>Some groupings have been inferred to be the same based
          on their subgrouping being the same, e.g. "EU 14".</li>
          <li>Some groupings, although they've been inferred to be the
          same, still show up multiple times as they are in different
          subdivisions.</li>
          <li>"World" and "All nationalities" are still distinct.</li>
        </ul>
        Note that the reasoner uses the "open world assumption", which
        means that until we can demonstrate that things are the same
        (or different), we can't assume they're not.
